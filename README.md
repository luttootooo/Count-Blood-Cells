# Count-Blood-Cells
<br> This project was one of the questions on my final examination of the Digital Image Processing course. This project aimed to count the number of blood cells of a given medical image. I applied several DIP techniques before counting the blood cells, such as converting the image into the grayscale channel, then sharpening the image by convoluting it with a kernel, followed by applying a segmentation algorithm to change the image into 2 colors, black and white, and last morphological processing to recognize the blood cells easier by performing erosion on the segmented image. The final touch was applying blob detector libraries to detect the blob on the image and count it simultaneously. The overall processes applied to this project could recognize almost whole blobs.
