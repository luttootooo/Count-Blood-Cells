# Count-Blood-Cells
<br> This project was one of the problems on my final examination of the Digital Image Processing course. This project aimed to count the number of blood cells of a given medical image. I applied several DIP techniques before counting the number of blood cells. First, I convert the image into the grayscale channel. The next step is sharpening the image by convoluting it with a kernel, followed by applying a segmentation algorithm to change the image into two colors, black and white, and last morphological processing to recognize the blood cells easier by performing erosion on the segmented image. The final touch was applying blob detector libraries to detect the blob on the image and count it simultaneously. The whole process used in this project could easily recognize almost entire blobs.
